# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Base image updated from `alpine:3.12` + manual Node/Python builds to `node:22-alpine`
  - Node.js: 14.13.1 → 22 LTS
  - Python: 3.7.9 (built from source) → 3.12 (via Alpine apk)
  - Removed ~220 lines of from-source build complexity
- Alpine base unpinned from `node:22-alpine3.21` to `node:22-alpine` to track latest security patches
- `apk upgrade --no-cache` added to apply all OS-level security patches at build time
- AWS CDK: v1 (individual pip packages) → v2 (`aws-cdk-lib` + `constructs`)
- npm updated to latest at build time to resolve bundled dependency CVEs
- Added non-root user (`node`, uid 1000) as default runtime user
- Removed Yarn installation (not required for CDK usage)

### CI/CD
- Replaced `elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action` with `docker/build-push-action@v6`
- Added Docker layer caching via GitHub Actions cache
- Added SLSA provenance attestation (`provenance: mode=max`) on main branch builds
- Added SBOM attestation (`sbom: true`) on main branch builds
- Integrated Docker Scout: vulnerability comparison on PRs, CVE recording on main
- Publish now triggers only on pushes to `main` (previously all branches)
